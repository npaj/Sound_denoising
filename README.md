# Sound denoising
Removing stationary noise with the method : Joint Maximum A Posteriori Spectral Amplitude and Phase Estimator
(deal with it)
# Requirements
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Run
To run, the noise reference and the signal to denoise are needed. Change the path to the wavefile in the code.
By default, a simulation with sines and noise is provided.
